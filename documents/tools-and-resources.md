## External resources

The best way to learn about web development is through the web itself! There are a lot great resources out there; below I've provided that I think you'll find useful:

* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn): Some of the best documentation on web development out there; this will serve as the textbook for the class.
