# [Web Application Development](https://gitlab.msu.edu/cse477-spring-2025/course-materials/): Homework Assignments



## Assignments

Below is an overview of the five assignments due in this course. Assignments are scheduled approximately once a month. Each assignment builds on the previous one (except for the Course Exam), making it crucial to complete each task correctly and on time. If you start early and watch the tutorials, you should find each homework assignment relatively straightforward. Solutions to the assignments will not be provided at any point during the course.

| Assignment | Goal of the Assignment                      | Requirements                                   | Released | Due  | Total Value | Rubric                                                       |

<u>NOTE:</u> All due dates are at 11:59 PM EST on the listed dates. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Late assignments will not be accepted without prior written permission, obtained at least 72 hours in advance of the deadline.</span>



### Assignment Submission:

Assignments are considered submitted when both of the following conditions are met:

1. Relevant code for the assignment is committed to the course GitLab repository.
2. The Homework survey is submitted (a link to the surveys are at the bottom of each homework).

Please note that deadlines and gading policies in CSE 477 are strictly enforced. **Assignments submitted even one second past the deadline, for any reason, will receive a grade of 0.** 



### Grading:

Each assignment will be graded according to its specific rubric (see the table above for rubric links). Grades will be posted as an "Issue" in your personal course repository <u>within two weeks of the submission deadline</u>. In the unlikely event of a grading error, you will have 24 hours to request a regrade. Requests submitted after this period will not be considered. The grading policy in CSE 477 is binary with respect to the rubric criteria: for each requirement, you will receive either full points for meeting the requirement or no points if any part of the requirement is missed. This approach is designed to eliminate subjectivity in grading, which may result in bias.



**PLEASE NOTE: you will receive a 0 on your assignment if:** 

* Any part of the assignment was submitted late; this includes: 

  * Commiting your code to GitLab
  * Deploying a functional web application via Google Cloud
  * Submitting the homework survey (i.e. the Google Form)

* Any part of the assignment was plagiarized, borrowed, or copied:

* The deployed web application is non functional

* The web application does not compile

  


#### Grade Drop Policy:

We understand that individual students will face individual problems at various times, for various reasons throughout the semester. For this reason, your lowest grade in the set of assignments {1, 2, 3} will be replaced with your next lowest grade in that same set of assignments (i.e. assignments {1, 2, 3}). For clarity, here are a few examples: 

* If you made a 0%, 90%, and 70% in Homework 1, 2, and 3 respectively - then your grade for Homework 1 would be changed from a 0% to a 70%.
* If you made a 0%, 0%, and 100% in Homework 1, 2, and 3 respectively - then your grade for Homework 1 would remain 0% (because your next lowest grade is also 0%).
* If you made a 10%, 0%, and 100% in Homework 1, 2, and 3 respectively - then your grade for Homework 2 would be changed from a 0% to a 10%.
