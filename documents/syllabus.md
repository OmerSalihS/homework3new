## Course Description

#### Description

This course provides an overview of contemporary techniques, and tools used for web application development. More specifically, this course covers the three essential technology components of web applications (frontend, backend, and databases), as well as the internet technologies used to host, distribute, and scale web applications. A list of key topics include: How the internet works, internet protocols, domain name servers, web hosting, HTML, CSS, Javascript, conventions and best practices, DOM manipulation, Python Flask, sessions, cookies, relational databases, NoSQL Databases, database optimization, containerization, version control systems, APIs and Micro-services. 

#### Objective 

Students completing this course are expected to be able to:

- Understand the unique aspects of web application design.

- Work in resource sensitive and resolution variant environments.

- Apply common patterns in web development.


#### Prerequisites and Requirements

Students are assumed to have taken: CSE 320 or CSE 331 or CSE 335. Students are also assumed to have access to a working personal computer or university laboratory computer where they can perform the assignments and engage with the course content. Also, please note that this course assumes that you are familiar with:

* **Unix**: Ideally, you should have access to a `Unix`-friendly computational environment (MacOS, Ubuntu, RedHat, etc.). I don't know enough about Windows to be able to support you if you face issues in that OS.
* **Python**: You should have basic familiarity with `Python3` , and package management tools  including the  `pip` package manager.
* **Git**: You should have  basic familiarity with `Git`; specifically: `clone`, `add`, `pull`, `commit` and `push`.
* **Markdown**: You have some basic familiarity with `Markdown` files and how to read/edit them.

| 0.00 - 59.49  | 0            |



## Key Policies and Clarifications: 

1. **Binary Grading Approach:** Assignments are graded according to criteria outlined in rubrics released with each assignment. Each requirement in the rubric is assessed on an "all or nothing" basis – partial credit will not be awarded. If any part of a requirement is missing, the entire point allocation for that section will be forfeited. This eliminates subjectivity in grading and ensures consistency across all students. 

2. **Assignment Submission Requirements:**  Assignments are considered submitted only when:

   1. The relevant code is committed to the course GitLab repository.
   2. The Dockerized web application is deployed to the web and functional.
   3. The homework survey (linked at the bottom of each assignment) is submitted. 

   Failure to meet <u>any one</u> of these conditions will result in a <u>grade of zero</u> for that assignment. 

3. **Extension Requests:**  Extension requests must be submitted <u>at least 72 hours prior to the assignment deadline</u>. Requests made within 72 hours of the deadline will not be considered. Written approval must be obtained before the deadline, and extensions will only be granted under exceptional circumstances with appropriate documentation.  
3. **Technical Issues:** Technical problems (e.g., GitLab access issues, Docker installation failures) are not grounds for extensions. It is the responsibility of  students to begin assignments early and seek help from the course staff as soon as issues arise. Documentation of technical problems does not guarantee extensions. 
3. **Regrade Requests:** Regrade requests must be submitted within 24 hours of the grade being posted. Requests submitted after this period will not be considered. 



## Additional Information

#### Special Needs and Circumstances

We are committed to ensuring equitable access and support for all students with documented special needs or circumstances. We recognize the importance of balancing accommodations with the integrity and fairness required in course assessments. Accommodation requests must be accompanied by formal documentation from the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities (RCPD) office, or an offical university alternative. **Accommodations can only be provided if documentation clearly and unambiguously overrides course policies.** This ensures alignment with ABET’s Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility, which requires fairness and integrity in evaluating students.

Importantly, while RCPD documentation serves as a valid reason for an extension, extension may only be granted if an extension request is made at least 72 hours in advance of the deadline. For the avoidance of doubt, a student does not qualify for an extension if their request is made within 72 hours of the deadline. Critically, retroactive extensions (i.e requests made after the extension request deadline) will not be considered unless RCPD documentation explicitly specifies retroactive applicability. Furthermore, repeated extension requests are subject to review to ensure they do not compromise the integrity of the course; granting extensions for more than one assignment exceeds the definition of "rare circumstances". 

#### Cloud Credits

Students are responsible for covering all cloud-related expenses associated with this course. Based on historical patterns, these costs typically do not exceed $20 for the duration of the semester. Google Cloud credits will **not** be provided, and students must secure their own resources to complete assignments and projects that require cloud services.

#### Academic Misconduct 

Any evidence of academic misconduct will result in an automatic failing grade in the course. Please [see here](https://ombud.msu.edu/resources-self-help/academic-integrity/what-is#:~:text=The%20Integrity%20of%20Scholarship%20and,of%20academic%20or%20admission%20records.) for MSU's definition of academic misconduct. You may discuss assignments in general terms with your classmates, the course staff, or the instructor, but you are not permitted to receive solutions from others (including the course staff) or to read or copy part or all of another person’s solution to a problem.

#### Sharing and Commercialization

Sharing and or Commercialization of course materials without prior written permission is not permitted. Posting of course materials, assignments, or solutions to any public or paid websites is strictly prohibited and may lead to disciplinary and/or legal action.

#### Disruptive Behavior

Article 2.3.5 of the Academic Freedom Report (AFR) for students at Michigan State University states that "The student's behavior in the classroom shall be conducive to the teaching and learning process for all concerned." Article 2.3.10 of the AFR states that "The student has a right to scholarly relationships with faculty based on mutual trust and civility." General Student Regulation 5.02 states that "no student shall . . . interfere with the functions and services of the University (for example, but not limited to, classes . . .) such that the function or service is obstructed or disrupted. Students whose conduct adversely affects the learning environment in this classroom may be subject to disciplinary action through the Student Faculty Judiciary process.
