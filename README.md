## About this course

This course offers a comprehensive overview of contemporary tools and techniques for modern web application development. It focuses on the three fundamental technology components of web applications: frontend, backend, and databases. Additionally, the course explores internet technologies utilized in hosting, distributing, and scaling web applications on the cloud. Specifically, this course aims to teach you:

1. How the internet functions and the technologies that underpin its creation.

2. The construction of the visual component of web applications, known as the frontend.

3. The development of the computational/analytic component of web applications, referred to as the backend.

4. The use of database technologies in enabling web applications to store, process, and dynamically act upon data.

5. The methods for hosting, managing, deploying, securing, and scaling web applications globally.

   


## Is CSE 477 right for you?

While we are delighted to welcome all students and learning styles to CSE 477, the course may not be well aligned with some students needs or pedagogical expectations. CSE 477 is an asynchronous, online class with strict assignment deadlines, and a challenging final exam. CSE 477 is also a senior-level elective class, which means that students who have reservations about course policies, content, or class procedures are encouraged to explore other elective options. Some particularly important things to note include:

1. **The "strict deadlines":** The deadlines in CSE 477 are strictly adhered to; an assignment that is submitted even 1 second past the deadline for any reason will receive a grade of 0. Strict adherence to deadlines is vital for maintaining academic rigor and fairness, ensuring that all students are evaluated under equal conditions and time constraints.  
2. **The "all or nothing" grading system:** The grading policy in CSE 477 is “all or nothing” with respect to clear and specific rubric conditions released with the assignments. To be clear, for a given rubric requirement, a student will either receive all the points for completing the requirement, or none of the points if any component of the requirement is missed.  This structure is to prevent subjectivity in the grading process, which can introduce bias against (or for) students. 
3. **The Final exam’s format, length and difficulty:** Within the last 2 weeks of the semester, students will complete an asynchronous take-home final exam that is worth 35% of the final course grade. Please note that, like any class, students are given more time to complete homework assignments than the exam; and, like any class, the purpose of the exam is to assess independent problem-solving and understanding of the course material – ergo, it would be against the spirit of our exam (like any exam) for us to offer students detailed implementation support or extensions.
